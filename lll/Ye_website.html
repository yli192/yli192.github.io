    <br/> <br/>

    I am a first year Ph.D student
    in <a href="http://engineering.jhu.edu/ece/">Electrical and Computer Engineering</a> at the <a href="http://www.jhu.edu/">Johns Hopkins University</a>.  My advisor is <a href="http://www.hopkinsradiology.org/dmip/faculty/frey/">Eric Frey</a>  at 
    the <a href="http://www.hopkinsradiology.org/dmip">Division of Medical Imaging Physics</a>.  My office is located at JHOC 4250. <br/> <br/>


    I graduated in 2013 from
    the <a href="http://illinois.edu">University of Illinois at
    Urbana-Champaign</a> with a
    B.S. in <a href="http://npre.illinois.edu/">Nuclear, Plasma, and Radiological Engineering</a> and a
    minor in <a href="http://www.physics.uiuc.edu/">Physics</a>. My undergraduate research advisor is <a href="http://npre.illinois.edu/directory/faculty/rizwan">Rizwan
    Uddin</a>.<br/> <br/>


    I can be reached by email at yli192@jhu.edu.

    <h2>Projects</h2>
    
    <p>Currently, my research foceses    on developing procedures to optimize the dose versus image quality tradeoff for pediatric nuclear medicine imaging. Here is a <a href="http://www.mit.edu/~lululi/pubs/poster-LOO.pdf">poster</a> of
    this research, and you can find my paper under
    "publications."    </p>
    <p>I worked on developing an open source method of characteristics
    code for reactor physics analysis with two other graduate students
    (awaiting for MIT license to go through before it can be publicly
    available; if you are a CRPG member, you have access to our
    private
    repo <a href="https://github.com/mit-crpg/OpenMOC">OpenMOC</a>
    and <a href="https://github.com/mit-crpg/OpenMOC-LOO">OpenMOC-LOO</a>).
    See "publications" for our paper published on annals of nuclear
    energy.  <br/><br/>

    Prior to graduate school, I worked on various fun projects,
    including "Optimization of the blanket geometry for SFR" with
    Prof. Forget summer of 2010
    (<a href="http://www.mit.edu/~lululi/pubs/SFR-Lulu-Li.pdf">pdf
    report</a>), "Investigation of the feedback mechanisms and
    calculation of the Doppler coefficients and sodium coefficients"
    with Prof. George Apostolakis summer of 09
    (<a href="http://www.mit.edu/~lululi/pubs/feedback-Lulu-Li.jpg">jpg
    poster</a>), and "Electrostatic binary orbits in Weightlessness"
    through NASA's Microgravity University Program with the
    publication: "Orbital dynamics of two electrically charged
    conducting spheres," American Journal of Physics, 78(10),
    1002-1006 (2010).</p>
